Welcome to the **omni**tronics GitHub Organisation. Here you'll find the source for current and past projects.

Future to-do list:

* Integrate GitHub Actions for CI/CD
* Configure Packages for hosting self-built nuget packages, removing dependency on submodules in git
* ~Set up pull requests with multiple reviewers~
* ~Set up repository locks on `main` branch for merges **only**~
